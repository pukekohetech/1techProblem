  "text": "Describe the design problem and write a brief for your project.\n\nIn your response, you must:\n- clearly explain what the problem or need is\n- identify who the stakeholder(s) are\n- explain why this is a problem and why it needs to be solved\n- describe the context or situation where the problem exists\n- explain what the design outcome needs to achieve (do not describe your final solution)\n- include any constraints or limitations that will affect the design\n\nYour answer should focus on the need, not the solution, and should guide the rest of your project.",
  "image": "",
  "hint": "To PASS, make sure you include ALL of these in your writing:\n\n1) What is wrong, missing, difficult, unsafe, or not working?\n2) Who is affected (name a group OR describe them like \u201canyone who\u2026\u201d)?\n3) Why does it matter (risk, discomfort, wasted time, frustration, safety, performance, etc.)?\n4) Where/when does it happen (school/home/daily use/throughout the day/between classes etc.)?\n5) What does the outcome need to DO (what it must achieve) \u2014 NOT what it will look like.\n6) What limits apply (cost, time, materials, size, rules, safety, sustainability)?\n\nTip: Write in full sentences. Explain links between ideas (e.g., problem \u2192 who it affects \u2192 why it matters).",
