          "image": "",
          "hint": "To PASS, make sure you include ALL of these in your writing:\n\n1) What is wrong, missing, difficult, unsafe, or not working?\n2) Who is affected (name a group OR describe them like “anyone who…”)?\n3) Why does it matter (risk, discomfort, wasted time, frustration, safety, performance, etc.)?\n4) Where/when does it happen (school/home/daily use/throughout the day/between classes etc.)?\n5) What does the outcome need to DO (what it must achieve) — NOT what it will look like.\n6) What limits apply (cost, time, materials, size, rules, safety, sustainability)?\n\nTip: Write in full sentences. Explain links between ideas (e.g., problem → who it affects → why it matters).",
